                  <h1> Explanation </h1>
                   <p>Conditionals describe the result of a certain condition.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The if clause tells you the condition (If you study hard) </li>
                            <li>the main clause tells you the result (you will pass your exams). </li>
                            <li>The order of the clauses does not change the meaning.</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                   <p>If you study hard, you will pass your exams.</p> 
                    <p>will pass your exams if you study hard.</p> 
                  <h2>Second conditional</h2>
                  <p>The second conditional is used to imagine present or future situations that are impossible or unlikely in reality.</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>If we had a garden, we could have a cat.</li>
                      <li>If I won a lot of money, I'd buy a big house in the country.</li>
                      <li>I wouldn't worry if I were you.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    
                  <p>  When if is followed by the verb be, it is grammatically correct to say if I were, if he were, if she were and if it were. However, it is also common to hear these structures with was, especially in the he/she form.</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>If I were you, I wouldn't mention it.</li>
                        <li>If she was prime minister, she would invest more money in schools.</li>
                        <li>He would travel more if he was younger.</li>
                      </ul>

                    <p> The structure is usually: if + past simple >> + would + infinitive.</p>
