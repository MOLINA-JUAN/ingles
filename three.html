                  <h1> Explanation </h1>
                   <p>Conditionals describe the result of a certain condition.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The if clause tells you the condition (If you study hard) </li>
                            <li>the main clause tells you the result (you will pass your exams). </li>
                            <li>The order of the clauses does not change the meaning.</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                    <p>If you study hard, you will pass your exams.</p> 
                    <p>will pass your exams if you study hard.</p> 
                  <h2>Third conditional</h2>
                  <p>We use it to think in situations from the past that didn't happen and imagine the results of it.</p>
                    
                    <p>To use participle verbs, we have to keep in mind if the verbs is regular (if it is, it's forms adding -ed at the end of the verb) or irregular ( in this case we use the third column in the list of irregular verbs.
                    Sometimes, we can use modals like could or might:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li> Would:If I had remembered it was your birthday, I would have bought you a present.</li>
                        <li>COULD: If I had saved my money, I could have gone on holiday.</li>
                        <li>MIGHT: If we had had time, we might have gone to the beach.</li>
                      </ul>
                  
                    <p>Another thing about the conditionals is that the order of the two sentences can change. </p>

                      <ul>
                        <li>If we start with the condition "if", we separe it with a coma.</li>
                        <li>Otherwise if we start with the sentence that contains the result, we don't need to use the coma.</li>
                      </ul>
                    
                    <p>The structure is If + past perfect, person + would + have + verb in past participle.</p>
